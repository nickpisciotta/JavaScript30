    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    //You can reassign the original variable, but the variable referecing the prior value will not be updated 
    // let age = 100; 
    // let age2 = age; 
    // console.log(age, age2); 
    // age = 200 
    // console.log(age, age2); 

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players; 
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    console.log(players, team);  
    // however what happens when we update that array?
    team[3] = "Lux"; 
    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
      const team2 = players.slice(); 
    // one day

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    team3 = [].concat(players); 
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players]; 
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    const team5 = Array.from(players); 
    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object
    const person = {
      name: "Nick", 
      age: 26
    }
   
    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person; 
    // captain.number = 99; 
    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 99, age: 20}); 
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    // const cap3 = {...person}; 
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
